# ML-algorithm-KMeans-from-Scratch-
KMeans Machine Learning algorithm implementation from scratch.

## Algorithm Implemented

- K-Means

## Installation and usage.

This project has 2 dependencies.

- `numpy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
- `Scikit-learn` for the data generation and testing.
- `Matplotlib` for the plotting.
- `Pandas` for loading data.

**NOTE**: Do note that, Only `numpy` is used for the implementations. Others
help in the testing of code, and making it easy for us, instead of writing that
too from scratch.

You can install these using the command below!

```sh
# Linux or MacOS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
